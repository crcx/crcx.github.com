  <p>I mostly write code for my personal use, but a few of my programs have
     proven useful to others.</p>
  <p>Lately I've been working exploring ways to make a simple
     <a href="http://getpeek.com">email-only device</a> aimed at non-techies
     into a significantly more useful platform. The results of this can
     be seen in <a href="http://charleschilders.com/ent">Ent</a>.</p>
  <p>Ent has a non-public side as well, including an IRC-via-email client
     and additional information sources that are currently limited to things
     I personally find interesting. Maybe I'll make them public someday...</p>
