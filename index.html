  <p>I am in my mid 20's, married, and have two children.</p>

  <p>My employer is <a href="http://denneyelectricsupply.com">Denney
     Electric Supply</a>. My primary roles there are purchasing and
     inventory management. I also assist in counter sales, web site
     maintenance, and various shipping/receiving roles as needed.
     My past employers include Target, A Beka Book, and Penndel
     Hardware</p>

  <p>Programming is my favorite, but not only, hobby. I have a
     definite bias towards concatenative languages, and have been
     using various Forth dialects for the last nine years. Along the
     way I have become the primary developer of two concatenative
     languages (<em>Retro</em>; a Forth system, and <em>Toka</em>; an experimental
     attempt at building a more modern Forth for scripting purposes).</p>

  <p>Most of the code I have written is intended specifically for
     my own use, or for jobs I have undertaken, but I have begun to
     share some small pieces via the forthlets project.</p>

  <p>I do have one major project which is used by many people daily.
     This is <em>Ent</em>, a custom email autoresponder which fetches
     a variety of information from various sources, repackages it for
     display on mobile email clients (such as the Peek and BlackBerry).
     There are currently 50 services provided free of charge via Ent,
     and work is under way to open the data sources to other developers
     for use in their applications.</p>
